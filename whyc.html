<p>As we studied earlier, 'C' is a base language for many programming languages. So, learning 'C' as the main language will play an important role while studying other programming languages. It shares th1e same concepts such as data types, operators, control statements and many more. 'C' can be used widely in various applications. It is a simple language and provides faster execution. There are many jobs available for a 'C' developer in the current market.<br>'C' is a structured programming language in which program is divided into various modules. Ea1ch module can be written separately and together it forms a single 'C' program. This structure makes it easy for testing, maintaining and debugging processes.<br>'C' contains 32 keywords, various data types and a set of powerful built-in functions that make programming very efficient.<br>Another feature of 'C' programming is that it can extend itself. A 'C' program contains various functions which are part of a library. We can add our features and functions to the library. We can access and use these functions anytime we want in our program. This feature 
makes it simple while working with complex programming.<br>Various compilers are available in the market that can be used for executing programs written in this language.<br>It is a highly portable language which means programs written in 'C' language can run on other machines. This feature is essential if we wish to use or execute the code on another computer.</p>
