<h1 class="head">WHY C?</h1>
<div class="intro">
<p>C was initially used for system development work, in particular the programs that makes up
the operating system. C was adopted as a system development language because it
produces code that runs nearly as fast as code written in assembly language. Some
examples of the use of C might be: </div>
<div class="unl">
<ul>
<li>Operating Systems
<li>Language Compilers
<li>Assemblers
<li>Text Editors
<li>Network Drivers
<li>Modern Programs
<li>Databases
<li>Language Interpreters
<li>Utilities
</ul> </div>

<h2>Hello World Prog</h2>
<p>A C program can vary from 3 lines to millions of lines and it should be written <br>
into one or more text files with extension <q>.c</q>.<br>
With this lets take a simple example:</p> </div>
<div class="code">
<pre>
     1. #include <stdio.h>
     2. int main()
     3. {
     4.  /* my first program in C */
     5.  printf("Hello, World! \n");
     6.
     7.  return 0;
     8.  }
</pre>
<div class="orl">
<ol>
<li>The first line of the program <em>#include <stdio.h></em> is a preprocessor command, which tells
    a C compiler to include stdio.h file before going to actual compilation.<em> stdio.h</em> is a file 
	from the library already present in the program.
<li>The next line int main() is the main function from where the execution of program begins.
<li>The next line <em>/*...*/</em> is ignored by the compiler.It has been put to add additional
    comments in the program. So such lines are called <em>comments</em> in the program.
<li>The next line <em>printf(...)</em> is another function available in C which causes the message
    "Hello, World!" to be displayed on the screen.
<li>The next line <em>return 0;</em> terminates main()function and returns the <em>value 0</em>.
</ol>
<h1 class="head"> Parts of Syntax in C</h1>
<h3>Tokens in C</h3>
<div class="cont">
<p>A C program consists of various tokens and <em>a token is either a keyword, an identifier, a
constant, a string literal, or a symbol.</em></p> </div>
<h3>Semicolon <q>;</q></h3>
<div class="cont">
<p>In C program, the semicolon is a <em>statement terminator</em>. That is, each individual statement
must be ended with a semicolon. It <em>indicates the end of one logical entity</em>.</p> </div>
<h3>Comments</h3>
<div class="cont">
<p>Comments are like helping text in your C program and they are <em>ignored by the compiler</em>.
They start with /* and terminates with the characters */</p> </div>
<h3>Identifiers</h3>
<div class="cont">
<p>
A C identifier is <em>a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-defined
item</em>. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore _ followed by zero
or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).</p>
<p>
C does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. C is a <em>case
sensitive programming language</em>. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different
identifiers in C. Here are some examples of acceptable identifiers:<br>
mohd, zara, abc, move_name, a_123
</p> 
</div>
<h3>Keywords</h3>
<div class="cont">
<p>The following list shows the <em>reserved</em> words in C. These reserved words may not be used as
constant or variable or any other identifier names.</p> </div>
<div class="tbl">
<table>
<tr>
 <th>auto</th> <th>else</th> <th>Long</th> <th> switch</th> <th>break</th> <th>enum</th> 
</tr>
<tr> 
 <th>register</th> <th>typedef</th> <th>case</th> <th>extern</th> <th>return</th> <th>union</th> 
</tr>
<tr>
 <th>char</th> <th>float</th> <th>short</th> <th>unsigned</th> <th>const</th> <th>for</th>
</tr>
<tr>
 <th>signed</th> <th>void</th> <th>continue</th> <th>goto</th> <th>sizeof</th> <th>volatile</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>default</th> <th>if</th> <th>static</th> <th>while</th> <th>do</th> <th>int</th>
