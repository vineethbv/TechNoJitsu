<font size="5">K&R</font>
<p>In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie published the first edition of The C Programming Language. This book, known to C programmers as "K&R", served for many years as an informal specification of the language. The version of C that it describes is commonly referred to as K&R C. The second edition of the book covers the later ANSI C standard, described below.</p>
<font size="5">C89</font>
<p>In 1983, the American National Standards Institute formed a committee, X3Jll, to establish a standard specification of C. The standard was completed in 1989 and ratified as ANSI X3.159-1989 "Programming Language C." This version of the language is often ref erred to as "ANSI C". Later on sometimes the label "C89" is used to distinguish it from C99 but using the same labelling method.</p>
<font size="5">C90</font>
<p>The same standard as C89 was ratified by the International Organization for Standardization as ISO/IEC 9899:1990, with only formatting changes, which is .sometimes referred to as C90. The ref ore, the terms 11'C8191 " and "C90''' reÂ·fer to essentially the same language.</p>
<font size="5">C95</font>
<p>In 1995, the ISO published an extension, called Amendment 1, for the ANSI-C standard. Its full name finally was ISO/IEC 9899/AMDI:1995 or nicknamed C95. Aside from error correction there were further changes to the language capabilities, Improved multi-byte and wide character support in the standard library,Several new core language features, including static array indices, designated initializers, compound literals, variable-length arrays, flexible array members, variadic macros,Removed several dangerous C89 language features such as implicit 
function declarations</p>
<font size="5">C11</font>
<p>In 2007, work began on another revision of the C standard, informally called "CIX" until its official publication on 2011-12-15. Th,e C standards committee adopted guidelines to limit the adoption of new features that had not been tested by existing implementations.</p>
