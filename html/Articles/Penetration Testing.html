    <h1>A beginners guide to Penetration Testing</h1>
    <div class="container">
      <h3>What is this?!</h3>
      <p id="description">
        Pentesting or penetration testing is an ethical hacking process which involves assessing an application or an organization’s infrastructure for different types of vulnerabilities. This process of pen testing helps to exploit the various vulnerabilities within the system and the reasons for these vulnerabilities include certain misconfigurations, poorly designed architecture, insecure code, etc.
        Thus, by performing pen testing, it eventually helps to identify vulnerabilities and the process delivers actionable reports that clearly explain each vulnerability, specifically how to exploit them along with how to fix them.
      </p>
      <h3>How does it help? Why even bother about it?!</h3>
      <p id="benefits">
        There are many ways an organization can benefit through the process of penetration testing like:
        <ul>
          <li>Identify vulnerabilities that would remain unidentified otherwise</li>
          <li>Discover new threats by any possible attackers or intruders</li>
          <li>Identify real-time vulnerabilities within systems and web applications</li>
          <li>Test the effectiveness of web application firewalls</li>
          <li>Test cyber-defence capability of the organization</li>
          <li>Identify and showcase real-time risks and vulnerabilities</li>
          <li>Find any possible insecurity within the system infrastructure network or an application</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>What types of penetration testing are there?</h3>
      <p id="categories">
        Penetration testing in whole being a process of <strong>testing security</strong> of an application or a system is categorized as:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>Network Penetration Testing</h4>
            In this type of pen testing, the physical structure of the system is checked primarily to identify risks in the network of the organization. In this testing, the penetration tester performs tests in the organization’s network and tries to find out flaws in the design, operation, or implementation of the respective company’s network. Various components of the organization such as computers, modems, remote access devices are all checked by the tester to exploit the possible vulnerabilities.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Physical Penetration Testing</h4>
            This method of physical penetration testing is done to simulate the real-world threats. The pen tester acts as a cyber-attacker and tries to break the physical barrier of security. This test is done to check for the vulnerabilities in physical controls like security cameras, lockers, barriers, sensors, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Web Application Penetration Testing</h4>
            This method of pen testing is done to check vulnerabilities or weaknesses within web-based applications. The web penetration testing looks out for any security issues that might occur due to insecure development due to design or code and identified potential vulnerabilities within websites and web apps. This type of testing is most needed for online shopping websites, banking apps, and other eCommerce websites which deal with online transactions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Wireless Network Penetration Testing</h4>
            This form of pen testing is done to examine the connection between all devices like laptops, computers, tablets, smart-phones, etc, that are connected to the organization’s Wifi. This form of pen testing is done to prevent any data leakage that can happen while sharing data from one device to another device through the Wi-Fi network.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>What are my roles and responsibilities if I chose to become a pentester?</h3>
      <p id="roles-1">
        The penetration testing is conducted by pen testers who design and plan simulations and security assessments that are designed to probe any potential weaknesses within the system or IT infrastructure or web apps.
        They are also responsible to document all the findings and deliver them to the clients or employees or to the organization. These pen testers perform the process of this testing either manually or by using certset of automated tools.
      </p>
      <h3>How are manual pentesters different from automated pentesters?</h3>
      <p id="roles-2">
        <table border="2" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="5">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Manual Pentester</th>
              <th>Automated Pentester</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Manual efforts are more needed to get better results for testing business logic vulnerabilities</td>
              <td>Automated tools can be used with very little human intervention, while manual testing cannot be performed for everything</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Manual penetration testing takes longer time</td>
              <td>Automated tools work faster and comparatively requires less time and perform the process with high speed</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>When there is new vulnerability or exploit released, most of the automated tools will have to wait for next update while humans can learn new technique and implement it quickly</td>
              <td>This method of pen testing is best suited for testing targets with large number of pay loads</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>With manual testing the false positives are less when compared to automated testing</td>
              <td>With automated pen testing, the false positives are comparatively more</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </p>
      <h3>Ok cool, but how do I actually do all this? How do I go about with this process?</h3>
      <p id="phases">
        This entire process is comprised of multiple stages. They go <strong>sequentially</strong> as follows:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Pre-engagement activities</li>
        <li>Reconnaissance phase</li>
        <li>Threat modelling & vulnerability identification</li>
        <li>Exploitation phase & post exploitation</li>
        <li>Comprehensive reporting</li>
        <li>Resolution phase</li>
        <li>Re-testing phase</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Now how do tackle this problem? What are the approaches I can follow?</h3>
      <p id="approaches">
        There are 3 usual approaches that any pentester would follow:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h4>Black box</h4>
          <p>
            Black box pen testing is also commonly known as external penetration testing. In this approach, the pen tester has no information about the IT infrastructure of the organization. This process appears to be more like simulation of real-world cyber-attack to check the vulnerabilities in the system.
            Specifically, in this method, the pen testers act as cyber-attackers and try to exploit the vulnerabilities that exist in the system. This process usually takes a lot of time and can take even up to six weeks to complete.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>White box</h4>
          <p>
            White box penetration testing is also known as internal penetration testing, clear box, or even known as glass box penetration testing. In this approach of pen testing, the pen tester is provided with the complete information of the IT Infrastructure, source code, and environment.
            It is a much detailed and in-depth type of pen test done wherein every area is checked such as the quality of code and the basic design of the application. Moreover, this type of pen testing approach usually takes two to three weeks to get completed.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>Gray box</h4>
          <p>
            In this approach of penetration testing, the pen tester is provided with partial information of IT infrastructure, and code structure. It is a more focused approach as the pen tester has partial knowledge or access to internal network or web application and can focus some effort on exploiting the possible vulnerabilities which typically saves a lot of time and cost.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Alright, what do I use in order to perform the required operations?</h3>
