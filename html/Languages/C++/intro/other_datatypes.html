        <h2 id="other">Other Data Types </h2>
        <h3 id="typedef">Defined data types (typedef)</h3>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>C++ allows the definition of our own types based on other existing data types. We can do this using the keyword
                typedef, whose format is:                 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="code">
            <pre>typedef existing_type new_type_name ;</pre>
        </div>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>where existing_type is a C++ fundamental or compound type and new_type_name is the name for the new type
                we are defining. For example:
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="code">
<pre>typedef char C;
typedef unsigned int WORD;
typedef char * pChar;
typedef char field [50];</pre>
        </div>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>In this case we have defined four data types: C, WORD, pChar and field as char, unsigned int, char* and
                char[50] respectively, that we could perfectly use in declarations later as any other valid type:                 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="code">
<pre>C mychar, anotherchar, *ptc1;
WORD myword;
pChar ptc2;
field name;</pre>
        </div>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>typedef does not create different types. It only creates synonyms of existing types. That means that the type of
                myword can be considered to be either WORD or unsigned int, since both are in fact the same type.<br>
                typedef can be useful to define an alias for a type that is frequently used within a program. It is also useful to
                define types when it is possible that we will need to change the type in later versions of our program, or if a type
                you want to use has a name that is too long or confusing.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3 id="Unions">Unions</h3>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>Unions allow one same portion of memory to be accessed as different data types, since all of them are in fact the
                same location in memory. Its declaration and use is similar to the one of structures but its functionality is totally
                different:
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="code">
<pre>union union_name {
member_type1 member_name1;
member_type2 member_name2;
member_type3 member_name3;
.
.
} object_names; 
   </pre>
        </div>
        <h3 id="anonymous">Anonymous unions </h3>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>In C++ we have the option to declare anonymous unions. If we declare a union without any name, the union will
                be anonymous and we will be able to access its members directly by their member names. For example, look at the
                difference between these two structure declarations:
            </p>
        </div>
        <h3 id="regular">structure with regular union</h3>
        <div class="code">
<pre>struct {
char title[50];
char author[50];
union {
float dollars;
int yens;
} price;
} book;</pre>
        </div>
        <h3 id="anonymousunion">structure with anonymous union</h3>
        <div class="code">
<pre>struct {
char title[50];
char author[50];
union {
float dollars;
int yens;
};
} book; 
   </pre>
        </div>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>The only difference between the two pieces of code is that in the first one we have given a name to the union
                (price) and in the second one we have not. The difference is seen when we access the members dollars and
                yens of an object of this type. For an object of the first type, it would be:
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="code">
<pre>book.price.dollars
book.price.yens</pre>
        </div>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>whereas for an object of the second type, it would be:
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="code">
<pre>book.dollars
book.yens</pre>
        </div>
        <h3 id="enum">Enumerations (enum) </h3>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>Enumerations create new data types to contain something different that is not limited to the values fundamental
                data types may take. Its form is the following: 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="code">
<pre>enum enumeration_name {
value1,
value2,
value3,
.
.
} object_names;</pre>
        </div>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>For example, we could create a new type of variable called color to store colors with the following declaration:
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="code">
<pre>enum colors_t {black, blue, green, cyan, red, purple, yellow, white};</pre>
        </div>
    </body>
