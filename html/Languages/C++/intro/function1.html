            <p>Using functions we can structure our programs in a more modular way, accessing all the potential that structured
                programming can offer to us in C++.<br>A function is a group of statements that is executed when it is called from some point of the program. The
                following is its format:  </p>
        </div>
        <div class="code">
            <pre>type name ( parameter1, parameter2, ...) { statements }</pre>
        </div>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>where: </p>
        </div>
        <div class="unl">
            <ul>
                <li>type is the data type specifier of the data returned by the function. </li>
                <li>name is the identifier by which it will be possible to call the function. </li>
                <li>parameters (as many as needed): Each parameter consists of a data type specifier followed by an
                    identifier, like any regular variable declaration (for example: int x) and which acts within the function as
                    a regular local variable. They allow to pass arguments to the function when it is called. The different
                    parameters are separated by commas. </li>
                <li>statements is the function's body. It is a block of statements surrounded by braces { }. </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Here you have the first function example: </p>

            <table>
                <tr>

#include < iostream >
using namespace std;
int addition (int a, int b)

    int r;
    r=a+b;
    return (r);

    int z;
    z = addition (5,3);

        <div class="cont">
            <p>In order to examine this code, first of all remember something said at the beginning of this tutorial: a C++
                program always begins its execution by the main function. So we will begin there.<br>
                We can see how the main function begins by declaring the variable z of type int. Right after that, we see a call to
                a function called addition. Paying attention we will be able to see the similarity between the structure of the call
                to the function and the declaration of the function itself some code lines above:<br>
            <b>int addition(int a,int b)<br>z=addition(5,3);</b><br>The parameters and arguments have a clear correspondence. Within the main function we called to addition
            passing two values: 5 and 3, that correspond to the int a and int b parameters declared for function addition. <br>At the point at which the function is called from within main, the control is lost by main and passed to function
            addition. The value of both arguments passed in the call (5 and 3) are copied to the local variables int a and int
            b within the function.<br>Function addition declares another local variable (int r), and by means of the expression r=a+b, it assigns to r
            the result of a plus b. Because the actual parameters passed for a and b are 5 and 3 respectively, the result is 8.<br>The following line of code:   </p>
        </div>
        <div class="code">
            <pre>return (r);</pre>
        </div>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>finalizes function addition, and returns the control back to the function that called it in the first place (in this case,
                main). At this moment the program follows it regular course from the same point at which it was interrupted by the
                call to addition. But additionally, because the return statement in function addition specified a value: the
                content of variable r (return (r);), which at that moment had a value of 8. This value becomes the value of
                evaluating the function call. <br><b>int addition(int a,int b)<br>z=addition(5,3);</b></p>
        </div>
        <h3 id="scope">Scope of variables </h3>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>The scope of variables declared within a function or any other inner block is only their own function or their own
                block and cannot be used outside of them. For example, in the previous example it would have been impossible to
                use the variables a, b or r directly in function main since they were variables local to function addition. Also, it
                would have been impossible to use the variable z directly within function addition, since this was a variable local
                to the function main. </p>

        <div class="cont">
            <p>Therefore, the scope of local variables is limited to the same block level in which they are declared. Nevertheless,
                we also have the possibility to declare global variables; These are visible from any point of the code, inside and
                outside all functions. In order to declare global variables you simply have to declare the variable outside any
                function or block; that means, directly in the body of the program.<br>And here is another example about functions:  </p>

        <div class="cont"><p>In this case we have created a function called subtraction. The only thing that this function does is to subtract
            both passed parameters and to return the result.<br>
            Nevertheless, if we examine function main we will see that we have made several calls to function subtraction.
            We have used some different calling methods so that you see other ways or moments when a function can be
            called. <br>In order to fully understand these examples you must consider once again that a call to a function could be
            replaced by the value that the function call itself is going to return. For example, the first case (that you should
            already know because it is the same pattern that we have used in previous examples): 
            </p></div>
            <div class="code">
                <pre>z = subtraction (7,2);
cout << "The first result is " << z;</pre>
            </div>
            <div class="cont">
                <p>If we replace the function call by the value it returns (i.e., 5), we would have:</p>
            </div>
            <div class="code">
                <pre>z = 5;
cout << "The first result is " << z;</pre>
            </div>
            <div class="cont">
                <p>As well as</p>
            </div>
            <div class="code">
                <pre>cout << "The second result is " << subtraction (7,2);</pre>
            </div>
            <div class="cont">
                <p>has the same result as the previous call, but in this case we made the call to subtraction directly as an insertion
                    parameter for cout. Simply consider that the result is the same as if we had written: </p>
            </div>
            <div class="code">
                <pre>cout << "The second result is " << 5;</pre>
            </div>
            <div class="cont">
                <p>since 5 is the value returned by subtraction (7,2).<br>
                    In the case of: </p>
            </div>
            <div class="code">
                <pre>cout << "The third result is " << subtraction (x,y);</pre>
            </div>
            <div class="cont">
                <p>The only new thing that we introduced is that the parameters of subtraction are variables instead of constants.
                    That is perfectly valid. In this case the values passed to function subtraction are the values of x and y, that are 5
                    and 3 respectively, giving 2 as result.<br>
                    The fourth case is more of the same. Simply note that instead of: 
                    </p>
            </div>
            <div class="code">
                <pre>z = 4 + subtraction (x,y);</pre>
            </div>
            <div class="cont">
                <p>we could have written: </p>
            </div>
            <div class="code">
                <pre>z = subtraction (x,y) + 4;</pre>
            </div>
            <div class="cont">
                <p>with exactly the same result. I have switched places so you can see that the semicolon sign (;) goes at the end of
                    the whole statement. It does not necessarily have to go right after the function call. The explanation might be once
                    again that you imagine that a function can be replaced by its returned value: </p>
            </div>
            <div class="code">
                <pre>z = 4 + 2;
z = 2 + 4;                    
                </pre>
            </div>
            <h3 id="void">Functions with no type. The use of void. </h3>
            <div class="cont">
                <p>If you remember the syntax of a function declaration: </p>
            </div>
            <div class="code">
                <pre>type name ( argument1, argument2 ...) statement</pre>
            </div>
            <div class="cont">
                <p>you will see that the declaration begins with a type, that is the type of the function itself (i.e., the type of the
                    datum that will be returned by the function with the return statement). But what if we want to return no value?<br>
                    Imagine that we want to make a function just to show a message on the screen. We do not need it to return any
                    value. In this case we should use the void type specifier for the function. This is a special specifier that indicates
                    absence of type. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="tbl">
                <table>
<tr><td><pre><i>// void function example</i>
#include < iostream.h >
using namespace std;
void printmessage ()
{
    cout << "I'm a function!";

    printmessage ();
    return 0;
}</pre></td>  <td><pre>I'm a function! </pre></td>

            </div>
            <div class="cont">
                <p>void can also be used in the function's parameter list to explicitly specify that we want the function to take no
                    actual parameters when it is called. For example, function printmessage could have been declared as: </p>
            </div>
            <div clas="code">
<pre>void printmessage (void)
{
    cout << "I'm a function!";
}</pre>
            </div>
            <div class="cont">
                <p>Although it is optional to specify void in the parameter list. In C++, a parameter list can simply be left blank if we
                    want a function with no parameters.<br>What you must always remember is that the format for calling a function includes specifying its name and
                    enclosing its parameters between parentheses. The non-existence of parameters does not exempt us from the
                    obligation to write the parentheses. For that reason the call to printmessage is:  </p>
            </div>
            <div class="code">
                <pre>printmessage ();</pre>
            </div>
            <div class="cont">
                <p>The parentheses clearly indicate that this is a call to a function and not the name of a variable or some other C++
                    statement. The following call would have been incorrect:</p>
