        <h2 id="DATATYPES"> DATA TYPES </h2>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>While writing program in any language, you need to use various variables to store various
                information. Variables are nothing but reserved memory locations to store values. This means
                that when you create a variable you reserve some space in memory.<br>
                You may like to store information of various data types like character, wide character, integer,
                floating point, double floating point, boolean etc. Based on the data type of a variable, the
                operating system allocates memory and decides what can be stored in the reserved memory.

            <p>The size of variables might be different from those shown in the above table, depending on
                the compiler and the computer you are using.<br>
                Following is the example, which will produce correct size of various data types on your
                computer.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="code">
            <pre>
#include < iostream.h >
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    cout << "Size of char : " << sizeof(char) << endl;
    cout << "Size of int : " << sizeof(int) << endl;
    cout << "Size of short int : " << sizeof(short int) << endl;

    return 0
}
            </pre>
        </div>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>This example uses <b>endl</b>, which inserts a new-line character after every line and << operator
                is being used to pass multiple values out to the screen. We are also using <b>sizeof()</b> function
                to get size of various data types.
                </p>
        </div>
        <h3 id="declaration">typedef Declarations</h3>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>You can create a new name for an existing type using <b>typedef</b>. Following is the simple syntax
                to define a new type using typedef:
            <pre>typedef type newname;</pre>For example, the following tells the compiler that feet is another name for int:
            <pre>typedef int feet;</pre>Now, the following declaration is perfectly legal and creates an integer variable called
            distance:
        <pre>feet distance;</pre></p>
        </div>
        <h3 id="enumerated">Enumerated Types</h3>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>An enumerated type declares an optional type name and a set of zero or more identifiers that
                can be used as values of the type. Each enumerator is a constant whose type is the
                enumeration.
                Creating an enumeration requires the use of the keyword <b>enum</b>. The general form of an
                enumeration type is:
            <pre>enum enum-name { list of names } var-list;</pre>Here, the enum-name is the enumeration's type name. The list of names is comma separated.<br>
            For example, the following code defines an enumeration of colors called colors and the variable
            c of type color. Finally, c is assigned the value "blue".
            <pre>enum color { red, green, blue } c;
            c = blue;</pre>By default, the value of the first name is 0, the second name has the value 1, and the third
            has the value 2, and so on. But you can give a name, a specific value by adding an initializer.
            For example, in the following enumeration, green will have the value 5.
            <pre>enum color { red, green=5, blue };</pre>Here, blue will have a value of 6 because each name will be one greater than the one that
            precedes it.</p>
        </div>
        <h3 id="definition">Variable Definition in C++</h3>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>A variable definition tells the compiler where and how much storage to create for the variable.
                A variable definition specifies a data type, and contains a list of one or more variables of that
                type as follows:
            <pre>type variable_list;</pre>Here, type must be a valid C++ data type including char, w_char, int, float, double, bool or
            any user-defined object, etc., and variable_list may consist of one or more identifier names
            separated by commas. Some valid declarations are shown here:
            <pre>
int i, j, k;
char c, ch;
float f, salary;
double d;
            </pre>The line int i, j, k; both declares and defines the variables i, j and k; which instructs the
            compiler to create variables named i, j and k of type int.<br>
            Variables can be initialized (assigned an initial value) in their declaration. The initializer
            consists of an equal sign followed by a constant expression as follows:
            <pre>type variable_name = value;</pre>Some examples are:
            <pre>extern int d = 3, f = 5;    <i> // declaration of d and f.</i>
int d = 3, f = 5;           <i> // definition and initializing d and f.</i>
byte z = 22;                <i> // definition and initializes z.</i>
char x = 'x';               <i> // the variable x has the value 'x'.</i>
                </pre></p>
        </div>
        <h3 id="declaration">Variable Declaration in C++</h3>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>A variable declaration provides assurance to the compiler that there is one variable existing
                with the given type and name so that compiler proceed for further compilation without
                needing complete detail about the variable. A variable declaration has its meaning at the time
                of compilation only, compiler needs actual variable declaration at the time of linking of the
                program.<br>A variable declaration is useful when you are using multiple files and you define your variable
                in one of the files which will be available at the time of linking of the program. You will
                use extern keyword to declare a variable at any place. Though you can declare a variable
                multiple times in your C++ program, but it can be defined only once in a file, a function or a
                block of code.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="code">
            <pre>#include < iostream.h >

<i>// Variable declaration:</i>
extern int a, b;
extern int c;
extern float f;
                
int main ()
{
    <i>// Variable definition:</i>
    int a, b;
    int c;
    float f;
    <i>// actual initialization</i>
    a = 10;
    b = 20;
    c = a + b;
    cout << c << endl ;
    f = 70.0/3.0;
    cout << f << endl ;
    return 0
}
</pre>
        </div>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>Same concept applies on function declaration where you provide a function name at the time
                of its declaration and its actual definition can be given anywhere else. For example:
                </p>
        </div>
        <div class="code">
            <pre>
<i>// function declaration</i>
int func();
int main()
{
    <i>// function call</i>
    int i = func();
}
<i>// function definition</i>
int func()
{
    return 0;
}                
            </pre>
        </div>
        <h3 id="rlvalues">Lvalues and Rvalues</h3>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>There are two kinds of expressions in C++:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="unl">
            <ul>
                <li><b>lvalue</b> : Expressions that refer to a memory location is called "lvalue" expression. An
                    lvalue may appear as either the left-hand or right-hand side of an assignment.</li>
                <li><b>rvalue</b> : The term rvalue refers to a data value that is stored at some address in
                    memory. An rvalue is an expression that cannot have a value assigned to it which
                    means an rvalue may appear on the right- but not left-hand side of an assignment.Variables are lvalues and so may appear on the left-hand side of an assignment. </li>
                </ul>
        </div>
        <h3 id="local">Local Variables</h3>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>Variables that are declared inside a function or block are local variables. They can be used
                only by statements that are inside that function or block of code. Local variables are not
                known to functions outside their own. Following is the example using local variables:
                </p>
        </div>
        <div class="code">
            <pre>#include < iostream.h >
using namespace std;
int main ()
{
    <i>// Local variable declaration:</i>
    int a, b;
    int c;
    <i>// actual initialization</i>
    a = 10;
    b = 20;
    c = a + b;
    cout << c;
    return 0;
}
            </pre>
        </div>
        <h3 id="global">GlobalVariables</h3>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>Global variables are defined outside of all the functions, usually on top of the program. The
                global variables will hold their value throughout the life-time of your program.<br>
                A global variable can be accessed by any function. That is, a global variable is available for
                use throughout your entire program after its declaration. Following is the example using global
                and local variables:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="code">
            <pre>#include < iostream.h >
