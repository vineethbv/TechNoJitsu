        <div class="intro">
            <p>Using the standard input and output library, we will be able to interact with the user by printing messages on the
                screen and getting the user's input from the keyboard.<br>
                C++ uses a convenient abstraction called streams to perform input and output operations in sequential media such
                as the screen or the keyboard. A stream is an object where a program can either insert or extract characters
                to/from it. We do not really need to care about many specifications about the physical media associated with the
                stream - we only need to know it will accept or provide characters sequentially.<br>
                The standard C++ library includes the header file iostream, where the standard input and output stream objects
                are declared. </p>
        </div>
        <h3 id="cout">Standard Output (cout) </h3>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>By default, the standard output of a program is the screen, and the C++ stream object defined to access it is <i>cout</i>.<br>
                <i>cout</i> is used in conjunction with the insertion operator, which is written as << (two "less than" signs). </p>
        </div>
        <div class="code">
<pre>cout << "Output sentence"; <i>// prints Output sentence on screen</i>
cout << 120;               <i>// prints number 120 on screen</i>
cout << x;                 <i>// prints the content of x on screen</i> </pre>
        </div>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>The << operator inserts the data that follows it into the stream preceding it. In the examples above it inserted the
                constant string Output sentence, the numerical constant 120 and variable x into the standard output stream cout.
                Notice that the sentence in the first instruction is enclosed between double quotes (") because it is a constant
                string of characters. Whenever we want to use constant strings of characters we must enclose them between
                double quotes (") so that they can be clearly distinguished from variable names. For example, these two sentences
                have very different results:</p>
            </div>
            <div class="code">
<pre>cout << "Hello"; <i>// prints Hello</i>
cout << Hello;   <i>// prints the content of Hello variable</i> </pre>
            </div>
            <div class="cont">
                <p>The insertion operator (<<) may be used more than once in a single statement: </p>
            </div>
            <div class="code">
<pre>cout << "Hello, " << "I am " << "a C++ statement";</pre>
            </div>
            <div class="cont">
                <p>This last statement would print the message Hello, I am a C++ statement on the screen. The utility of repeating
                    the insertion operator (<<) is demonstrated when we want to print out a combination of variables and constants or
                    more than one variable: </p>
            </div>
            <div class="code">
                <Pre>cout << "Hello, I am " << age << " years old and my zipcode is " << zipcode;</i></pre>
            </div>
            <div class="cont">
                <p>If we assume the age variable to contain the value 24 and the zipcode variable to contain 90064 the output of the
                    previous statement would be:</p>
            </div>
            <div class="code">
                <pre>Hello, I am 24 years old and my zipcode is 90064 </pre>
            </div>
            <div class="cont">
                <p>It is important to notice that cout does not add a line break after its output unless we explicitly indicate it,
                    therefore, the following statements:</p>
            </div>
            <div class="code">
                <pre>cout << "This is a sentence.";
cout << "This is another sentence."; </pre>
            </div>
            <div class="cont">
                <p>will be shown on the screen one following the other without any line break between them:</p>
            </div>
            <div class="code">
                <pre>This is a sentence.This is another sentence. </pre>
            </div>
            <div class="cont">
                <p>even though we had written them in two different insertions into cout. In order to perform a line break on the
                    output we must explicitly insert a new-line character into cout. In C++ a new-line character can be specified as \n
                    (backslash, n):</p>
            </div> 
            <div class="code">
<pre>cout << "First sentence.\n ";
cout << "Second sentence.\nThird sentence."; </pre>
            </div>
            <div class="cont">
                <p>This produces the following output:</p>
            </div>
            <div class="code">
<pre>First sentence.
Second sentence.
Third sentence.
</pre>
            </div>
            <div class="cont">
                <p>Additionally, to add a new-line, you may also use the endl manipulator. For example:</p>
            </div>
            <div class="code">
<pre>cout << "First sentence." << endl;
cout << "Second sentence." << endl;</pre>                
            </div>
            <div class="cont">
                <p>would print out:</p>
            </div>
            <div class="code">
<pre>First sentence.
Second sentence. 
</pre> 
            </div>
            <div class="cont">
                <p>The endl manipulator produces a newline character, exactly as the insertion of '\n' does, but it also has an additional behavior when it is used with buffered streams: the buffer is flushed. Anyway, cout will be an
                    unbuffered stream in most cases, so you can generally use both the \n escape character and the endl manipulator
                    in order to specify a new line without any difference in its behavior. </p>
            </div>
        <h3 id="cin">Standard Input (cin)</h3>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>The standard input device is usually the keyboard. Handling the standard input in C++ is done by applying the
                overloaded operator of extraction (>>) on the cin stream. The operator must be followed by the variable that will
                store the data that is going to be extracted from the stream. For example: </p>
        </div>
        <div class="code">
<pre>int age;
cin >> age; </pre>
        </div>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>The first statement declares a variable of type int called age, and the second one waits for an input from cin (the
                keyboard) in order to store it in this integer variable. <br>cin can only process the input from the keyboard once the RETURN key has been pressed. Therefore, even if you
                request a single character, the extraction from cin will not process the input until the user presses RETURN after
                the character has been introduced.<br>You must always consider the type of the variable that you are using as a container with cin extractions. If you
                request an integer you will get an integer, if you request a character you will get a character and if you request a
                string of characters you will get a string of characters.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="code">
<pre><i>// i/o example</i>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;
int main ()
{
    int i;
    cout << "Please enter an integer value: ";
    cin >> i;
    cout << "The value you entered is " << i;
    cout << " and its double is " << i*2 << ".\n";
    return 0;
} </pre>
        </div>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>You can also use cin to request more than one datum input from the user: <pre>cin >> a >> b;</pre>
                is equivalent to: </p>
        </div>
        <div class="code">
<pre>cin >> a;
cin >> b;
</pre> 
        </div>
