            The C++ language is an object-oriented programming language & is a
            combination of both low-level & high-level language – a Middle-Level
            Language. The programming language was created, designed & developed
            by a Danish Computer Scientist – Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Telephone
            Laboratories (now known as Nokia Bell Labs) in Murray Hill, New
            Jersey. As he wanted a flexible & a dynamic language which was
            similar to C with all its features, but with additionality of active
            type checking, basic inheritance, default functioning argument,
            classes, inlining, etc. and hence C with Classes (C++) was launched.

          <ul>
            <li>
              The trace of the programming language C++ can be done back to 1979
              when<b> Bjarne Stroustrup</b> was doing some development for this
              thesis for PhD. One in all the words Stroustrup had the chance to
              figure with, was a language referred to as <b>Simula</b>, that
              because the name implies, could be a language primarily designed
              for simulations. The Simula sixty-seven language – that was the
              variant that Stroustrup worked with is considered the primary
              language to support the object-oriented programming paradigm.
              Stroustrup found that this paradigm was helpful for package
              development; but, the Simula language was way too slow for
              practice & practical use.
            </li>
            <li>
              Shortly subsequently, he began work on “<b>C with Classes</b>“,
              because what the name implies was meant to be a superset of the C
              language. His main dream was to get his advanced object-oriented
              programming, created by him, into the C language, which was during
              his era was still the programming language that was widely
              respected for its movability, portability & compactness, by not
              sacrificing the speed or the low-level practicality. His
              programming-language enclosed inlining, basic inheritance, default
              function arguments, categories, and reliable sort was checking
              additionally to all or any the options of the C language.
            </li>
            <li>
              The first C with categories compiler was referred to as
              <b>Cfront</b>, that got derived from a C compiler referred to as<b>
                CPre</b
              >. It had been a program designed to translate C with categories
              code to universal C. A rather attention-grabbing purpose value
              noting is that Cfront was written mostly in C with classes,
              creating it a self-hosting compiler (a compiler which will compile
              itself). Cfront would later be abandoned in 1993 when it became
              troublesome to integrate new options into it, mainly C++
              exceptions. Even so, Cfront created a significant impact on the
              implementations of future compilers and also the operating system
              UNIX.
            </li>
            <li>
              In 1983, the name of the language got modified from C with
              categories to C++. The ++ operator within the C language is the
              associate operator for incrementing a variable, which provides
              some insight into however Stroustrup regarded the programing
              language. Several new options got additional around this point,
              the foremost notable of that area unit virtual functions, perform
              overloading, references with the const keyword, and single-line
              comments by using the two forward slashes (which may be a feature
              taken from the language<b> BCPL</b>).
            </li>
            <li>
              In 1985, Stroustrup’s relation to the language entitled The
              <b>C++ programing language</b> was printed and got released. That
              very same year, C++ got enforced as an advertisement product and
              hence starting of it as a commercial element. The programing
              language wasn’t formally standardized, nevertheless creating the
              book an essential reference. The programing language was updated
              once more in 1989 to incorporate protected and static members,
              still as an associate inheritance from many categories & classes.
            </li>
            <li>
              In 1990, <b>The Annotated C++ manual</b>, which was a reference
              got released all over. In 1990 only, in the same & identical year,
              Borland’s <b>Turbo C++ compiler</b> would also be commercially
              discharged as an advertisement product. Turbo C++ additional an
              excessiveness of other libraries which might have a substantial
              impact on C++’s development. Though Turbo C++’s last stable
              unharness was in 2006, the compiler continues to get widely used.
            </li>
            <li>
              In 1998, the C++ customary advisory & standards committee printed
              the first international standard for
              <b>C++ ISO/IEC 14882:1998</b>, which might be informally called
              C++98. The Annotated C++ manual was aforementioned to be a
              significant influence within the development of the quality. The
              quality template library (also known as the Standard Template
              Library) that began its intellectual construction in 1979 got
              additionally enclosed in it. In 2003, the committee well-versed
              multiple issues that were according with their 1998 customary and
              revised it consequently. The modified language got dubbed as
              <b>C++03</b>.
            </li>
            <li>
              In 2005, the same committee of C++ discharged a technical report
              (called as <b>TR1</b>) particularization varied options they were
              aiming to boost the newest C++ standard. The new rule was
              informally dubbed <b>C++0x</b> because it was expected to be
              discharged someday before the tip of the first decade. Ironically,
              however, the new customary wasn’t fulfilled until mid-2011. Many
              technical reports were discharged up till then, and a few
              compilers began adding experimental support for the new options
              and features.
            </li>
            <li>
              In mid-2011, the new C++ customary (dubbed <b>C++11</b>) got
              finished. The Boost library project created a substantial impact
              on the new rule, and a few of the new modules were derived
              directly from the corresponding Boost libraries. A number of the
              new options that got included were:
