        <h2 id="array">Arrays</h2>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>An array is a series of elements of the same type placed in contiguous memory locations that can be individually
                referenced by adding an index to a unique identifier.<br>
                That means that, for example, we can store 5 values of type int in an array without having to declare 5 different
                variables, each one with a different identifier. Instead of that, using an array we can store 5 different values of the
                same type, int for example, with a unique identifier.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="cont">
            <p> A typical declaration for an array in C++ is: 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="code">
            <pre>type name [elements];
            </pre>
        </div>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>where type is a valid type (like int, float...), name is a valid identifier and the elements field (which is always
                enclosed in square brackets []), specifies how many of these elements the array has to contain.<br>
                Therefore, in order to declare an array called billy as the one shown in the above diagram it is as simple as:
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="code">
            <pre>int billy [5];
            </pre>
        </div>
        <h3 id="initializing">Initializing arrays. </h3>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>When declaring a regular array of local scope (within a function, for example), if we do not specify otherwise, its
                elements will not be initialized to any value by default, so their content will be undetermined until we store some
                value in them. The elements of global and static arrays, on the other hand, are automatically initialized with their
                default values, which for all fundamental types this means they are filled with zeros.<br>
                In both cases, local and global, when we declare an array, we have the possibility to assign initial values to each
                one of its elements by enclosing the values in braces { }. For example: 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="code">
            <pre>int billy [5] = { 16, 2, 77, 40, 12071 }; 
            </pre>
        </div>
        <h3 id="accessing">Accessing the values of an array. </h3>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>In any point of a program in which an array is visible, we can access the value of any of its elements individually as
                if it was a normal variable, thus being able to both read and modify its value. The format is as simple as: 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="code">
            <pre>name[index] 
            </pre>
        </div>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>example:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="code">
<pre><i>// arrays example</i>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;
int billy [] = {16, 2, 77, 40, 12071};
int n, result=0;
int main ()
{
    for ( n=0 ; n<5 ; n++ )
    {
        result += billy[n];
    }
    cout << result;
    return 0;
} 
</pre>
          
        </div>
        <div class="cont">
            <p>output:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="code">
            <pre>12206 </pre>
        </div>
    <h3 id="multi">Multidimensional arrays </h3>
    <div class="cont">
        <p>Multidimensional arrays can be described as "arrays of arrays". For example, a bidimensional array can be
            imagined as a bidimensional table made of elements, all of them of a same uniform data type.<br>Multidimensional arrays are not limited to two indices (i.e., two dimensions). They can contain as many indices as
            needed. But be careful! The amount of memory needed for an array rapidly increases with each dimension. For
            example:
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="code">
        <pre>char century [100][365][24][60][60];
        </pre>
    </div>
    <div class="cont">
        <p>example:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="code">
<pre>#define WIDTH 5
#define HEIGHT 3
int jimmy [HEIGHT][WIDTH];
int n,m;
int main ()
{
    for (n=0;n < HEIGHT;n++)
        for (m=0;m < WIDTH;m++)
        {
            jimmy[n][m]=(n+1)*(m+1);
        }
    return 0;
} </pre>
    </div>
    <h3 id="pseudo">pseudo-multidimensional array</h3>
    <div class="cont">
        <p>example:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="code">
<pre>
#define WIDTH 5
#define HEIGHT 3
int jimmy [HEIGHT * WIDTH];
int n,m;
int main ()
{
    for (n=0;n < HEIGHT;n++)
        for (m=0;m < WIDTH;m++)
        {
            jimmy[n*WIDTH+m]=(n+1)*(m+1);
        }
    return 0;
} 
    
</pre>
    </div>
    <h3 id="parameter">Arrays as parameters</h3>
    <div class="cont">
        <p>At some moment we may need to pass an array to a function as a parameter. In C++ it is not possible to pass a
            complete block of memory by value as a parameter to a function, but we are allowed to pass its address. In
            practice this has almost the same effect and it is a much faster and more efficient operation.<br>
            In order to accept arrays as parameters the only thing that we have to do when declaring the function is to specify
            in its parameters the element type of the array, an identifier and a pair of void brackets []. For example, the
            following function:
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="code">
        <pre>void procedure (int arg[])
        </pre>
    </div>
    <div class="cont">
        <p>accepts a parameter of type "array of int" called arg. In order to pass to this function an array declared as: 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="code">
        <pre>int myarray [40];
        </pre>
    </div>
    <div class="cont">
        <p>it would be enough to write a call like this: 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="code">
        <pre>procedure (myarray);
        </pre>
    </div>
    <div class="cont">
        <p>Here you have a complete example:
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="code">
<pre><i>// arrays as parameters</i>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;
void printarray (int arg[], int length) {
    for (int n=0; n < length; n++)
        cout << arg[n] << " ";
    cout << "\n";
}
int main ()
{
    int firstarray[] = {5, 10, 15};
    int secondarray[] = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10};
    printarray (firstarray,3);
    printarray (secondarray,5);
    return 0;
}</pre>
    </div>
    <div classs="cont">
        <P>output:</P>
    </div>
    <div class="code">
<pre>5 10 15
2 4 6 8 10
</pre>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="cont">
        <p>As you can see, the first parameter (int arg[]) accepts any array whose elements are of type int, whatever its
            length. For that reason we have included a second parameter that tells the function the length of each array that we pass to it as its first parameter. This allows the for loop that prints out the array to know the range to iterate in
            the passed array without going out of range. <br>In a function declaration it is also possible to include multidimensional arrays. The format for a tridimensional array
            parameter is:
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="code">
        <pre>base_type[][depth][depth]
        </pre>
    </div>
    <div class="cont">
        <p>for example, a function with a multidimensional array as argument could be: 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="code">
        <pre>void procedure (int myarray[][3][4])
        </pre>
    </div>
    <div class="cont">
        <p>Notice that the first brackets [] are left blank while the following ones are not. This is so because the compiler
            must be able to determine within the function which is the depth of each additional dimension.<br>
            Arrays, both simple or multidimensional, passed as function parameters are a quite common source of errors for
            novice programmers. I recommend the reading of the chapter about Pointers for a better understanding on how
            arrays operate
