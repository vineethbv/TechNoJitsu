<h2 id="union"> C Unions</h2>
<div class="cont">
    <p>A union is a special data type available in C that enables you to store different data
        types in the same memory location. You can define a union with many members, but only
        one member can contain a value at any given time. Unions provide an efficient way of
        using the same memory location for multi-purpose.</p></div>
    <h3 id="uniondefine">Defining a Union</h3>
    <div class="cont">
        To define a union, you must use the union statement in very similar was as you did while
    defining structure. The union statement defines a new data type, with more than one
    member for your program. The format of the union statement is as follows:
    </div>
</div>
<div class="code">
<pre>
union [union tag]
{
 member definition;
 member definition;
 ...
 member definition;
} [one or more union variables];
</pre>
</div>
<div class="cont">
The union tag is optional and each member definition is a normal variable definition, such
as int i; or float f; or any other valid variable definition. At the end of the union's definition,
before the final semicolon, you can specify one or more union variables but it is optional.
Here is the way you would define a union type named Data which has the three members i,
f, and str:
</div>
<div class="code">
<pre>
union Data
{
 int i;
 float f;
 char str[20];
} data;
</pre>
</div> 
<div class="cont">
<p>A variable of Data type can store an integer, a floating-point number, or a string of
    characters. This means that a single variable i.e. same memory location can be used to
    store multiple types of data. You can use any built-in or user defined data types inside a
    union based on your requirement.</p>
<p>The memory occupied by a union will be large enough to hold the largest member of the
    union. For example, in above example Data type will occupy 20 bytes of memory space
    because this is the maximum space which can be occupied by character string.<br><b>Example:</b></p>
</div>
<div class="code">
<pre>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
union Data
{
 int i;
 float f;
 char str[20];
};
int main( )
{
 union Data data;
 printf( "Memory size occupied by data : %d\n", sizeof(data));
 return 0;
}
</pre>
</div>
<div class="cont">
    <b>Output:</b>
    <br>Memory size occupied by data : 20
</div>
<h3 id="accessunion">Accessing Union Members</h3>
<div class="cont">
    To access any member of a union, we use the member access operator <strong>(.)</strong>. <strong>The member
    access operator is coded as a period between the union variable name and the union
    member that we wish to access</strong>. You would use union keyword to define variables of union
    type. The following program  explains usage of union:
</div>
<div class="code">
<pre>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
union Data
{
 int i;
 float f;
 char str[20];
};
int main( )
{
 union Data data;
 data.i = 10;
 data.f = 220.5;
 strcpy( data.str, "C Programming");
 printf( "data.i : %d\n", data.i);
 printf( "data.f : %f\n", data.f);
 printf( "data.str : %s\n", data.str);
 return 0;
}
</pre>
</div>
<div class="cont">
    Output:<br>
<pre>
data.i : 1917853763
data.f : 4122360580327794860452759994368.000000
data.str : C Programming
</pre><br>
<p>Here, we can see that values of i and f members of union got corrupted because final value
    assigned to the variable has occupied the memory location and this is the reason that the
    value if str member is getting printed very well. Now let's look into the same example once
    again where we will use one variable at a time which is the main purpose of having union:</p>
</div>
<div class="code">
<pre>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
union Data
{
 int i;
 float f;
 char str[20];
};
int main( )
{
 union Data data;
 data.i = 10;
 printf( "data.i : %d\n", data.i);

 data.f = 220.5;
 printf( "data.f : %f\n", data.f);

 strcpy( data.str, "C Programming");
 printf( "data.str : %s\n", data.str);
 return 0;
}
</pre>
</div>
<div class="cont"> Output:<br>
<pre>
data.i : 10
data.f : 220.500000
data.str : C Programming
</pre>
</div>

<h2 id="typedef">Typedef</h2>
<div class="cont">
The C programming language provides a keyword called typedef, which you can use
to give a type a new name. Following is an example to define a term BYTE for one-byte
numbers:
</div>
<div class="code">typedef unsigned char BYTE;</div>
<div class="cont">
After this type definitions, the identifier BYTE can be used as an abbreviation for the
type unsigned char, for example:
</div>
<div class="code">BYTE b1, b2;</div>
<div class="cont">
    You can use typedef to give a name to user defined data type as well. For example you can
    use typedef with structure to define a new data type and then use that data type to define
    structure variables directly as follows:
</div>
<div class="code">
<pre>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
typedef struct Books
{
 char title[50];
 char author[50];
 char subject[100];
 int book_id;
} Book;
int main( )
{
 Book book;
 strcpy( book.title, "C Programming");
 strcpy( book.author, "Nuha Ali");
 strcpy( book.subject, "C Programming Tutorial");
 book.book_id = 6495407;
 printf( "Book title : %s\n", book.title);
 printf( "Book author : %s\n", book.author);
 printf( "Book subject : %s\n", book.subject);
 printf( "Book book_id : %d\n", book.book_id);
 return 0;
}
</pre>
</div>
<div class="cont">
    Output:
<pre>
Book title : C Programming
Book author : Nuha Ali
Book subject : C Programming Tutorial
Book book_id : 6495407
</pre>
</div>
