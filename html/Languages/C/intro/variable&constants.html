    <h2 id="variable">VARIABLES</h2>
<div class="cont">
    <p>A variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can
        manipulate. Each variable in C has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of
        the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the
        set of operations that can be applied to the variable.<br>
       Variable names can contain alphabets numbers and underscore. Variable name never starts with a 
       number and its case sensitive also. These are the predefined types :</p>

<div>
<table>
    <tr><th>TYPE</th><th>DESCRIPTION</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Char</td><td> Typically a single octet(one byte). This is an integer type.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Int</td><td> The most natural size of integer for the machine.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Float</td><td> A single-precision floating point value.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Double</td><td> A double-precision floating point value.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Void</td><td> Represents the absence of type.</td></tr>

</table>
</div>
<h3>DECLARATION</h3>
<div class="cont">
    <p>A variable declaration provides assurance to the compiler that there is one variable existing with
       the given type and name. A variable declaration has its meaning at the time of
       compilation only, compiler needs actual variable declaration at the time of linking of the program.<br>
       The syntax for declaration is:
       <pre> data_type  variable_name ;</pre>
        </p></div>
<div class="code"><p><pre>
    #include<stdio.h>
    // Variable definition:
    extern int a, b;
    extern int c;
    extern float f;
    int main ()
    {
    // Variable definition:
    int a, b;
    int c;
    float f;
    // actual initialization
     a =10;</pre></p></div>

<h3 >L AND R VALUE</h3>
<div class="cont"><p>
    <strong>lvalue:</strong> An expression that is an lvalue may appear as either the left-hand or right-hand
    side of an assignment.<br>
    <strong>rvalue:</strong> An expression that is an rvalue may appear on the right- but not left-hand side
    of an assignment.<br>
    In an assignment the lvalue comes at the left side and rvalue at the right side.<br>
    Ex: <span class="code"> int g=20 ;</span><br>
    Here <strong>r value</strong> is <strong>20</strong> and the <strong>l value</strong> is the <strong>memory location/address value</strong> 
    of the variable.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="constant">CONSTANTS</h2>
<div class="cont">
    <p>The constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter during its
       execution. These fixed values are also called literals.<br>
       Constants can be defined by two methods:
       <ul class="unl">
           <li>Variable constant with help of <strong>const</strong> keyword</li>
           <li>Constants with <strong>#define</strong> preprocessor</li>
       </ul></div>
    <h3 >const</h3>
    <div class="cont">
        Variable basic data types like an <strong>integer</strong> constant, a <strong>floating</strong>
        constant, a <strong>character</strong> constant, or a string literal can be declared with the help of beow mentioned syntax.<br>
        Syntax : <span class="code"> const data_type variable_name;</span></p>
    </div>
    <div class="code">
        <pre>#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
const int LENGTH = 10;
const int WIDTH = 5;
const char NEWLINE = '\n';
int area;
           
area = LENGTH * WIDTH;
printf("value of area : %d", area);
printf("%c", NEWLINE);
return 0;
}</pre>
    </div><span class="cont">Output: value of area : 50</span>
    <h3 >#define</h3>
        <p>This is used in code for making general constant value where the value assigned to the quantity which could be anything.<br></p>
        <span class="code">#define pi 3.14159</span>
    </div>
