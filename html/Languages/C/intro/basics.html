<h2 class="head">WHY C?</h2>
<div class="intro">
<p>C was initially used for system development work, in particular the programs that makes up
the operating system. C was adopted as a system development language because it
produces code that runs nearly as fast as code written in assembly language. Some
examples of the use of C might be: </div>
<div class="unl">
<ul>
<li>Operating Systems
<li>Language Compilers
<li>Assemblers
<li>Text Editors
<li>Network Drivers
<li>Modern Programs
<li>Databases
<li>Language Interpreters
<li>Utilities
</ul> </div>
<div class="cont">
<h2>Hello World Prog</h2>
<p>A C program can vary from 3 lines to millions of lines and it should be written <br>
into one or more text files with extension <q>.c</q>.<br>
With this lets take a simple example:</p> </div>
<div class="code">
<pre>
     1. #include <stdio.h>
     2. int main()
     3. {
     4.  /* my first program in C */
     5.  printf("Hello, World! \n");
     6.
     7.  return 0;
     8.  }
</pre></div>
<div class="orl">
<ol class="orl">
<li>The first line of the program <em>#include <stdio.h></em> is a preprocessor command, which tells
    a C compiler to include stdio.h file before going to actual compilation.<em> stdio.h</em> is a file 
	from the library already present in the program.
<li>The next line int main() is the main function from where the execution of program begins.
<li>The next line <em>/*...*/</em> is ignored by the compiler.It has been put to add additional
    comments in the program. So such lines are called <em>comments</em> in the program.
<li>The next line <em>printf(...)</em> is another function available in C which causes the message
    "Hello, World!" to be displayed on the screen.
<li>The next line <em>return 0;</em> terminates main()function and returns the <em>value 0</em>.
</ol></div>
<h1 class="head"> Parts of Syntax in C</h1>
<h3>Tokens in C</h3>
<div class="cont">
<p>A C program consists of various tokens and <em>a token is either a keyword, an identifier, a
constant, a string literal, or a symbol.</em></p> </div>
<h3>Semicolon <q>;</q></h3>
<div class="cont">
<p>In C program, the semicolon is a <em>statement terminator</em>. That is, each individual statement
must be ended with a semicolon. It <em>indicates the end of one logical entity</em>.</p> </div>
<h3>Comments</h3>
<div class="cont">
<p>Comments are like helping text in your C program and they are <em>ignored by the compiler</em>.
They start with /* and terminates with the characters */</p> </div>
<h3>Identifiers</h3>
<div class="cont">
<p>
A C identifier is <em>a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-defined
item</em>. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore _ followed by zero
or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).</p>
<p>
C does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. C is a <em>case
sensitive programming language</em>. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different
identifiers in C. Here are some examples of acceptable identifiers:<br>
mohd, zara, abc, move_name, a_123
</p> 
</div>
<h3>Keywords</h3>
<div class="cont">
<p>The following list shows the <em>reserved</em> words in C. These reserved words may not be used as
constant or variable or any other identifier names.</p> </div>
<div class="tbl">
<table>
<tr>
 <th>auto</th> <th>else</th> <th>Long</th> <th> switch</th> <th>break</th> <th>enum</th> 
</tr>
<tr> 
 <th>register</th> <th>typedef</th> <th>case</th> <th>extern</th> <th>return</th> <th>union</th> 
</tr>
<tr>
 <th>char</th> <th>float</th> <th>short</th> <th>unsigned</th> <th>const</th> <th>for</th>

<tr>
<th>default</th> <th>if</th> <th>static</th> <th>while</th> <th>do</th> <th>int</th>
</tr>
<tr> <th>struct</th> <th>packed</th><th>double</th>
</tr> 
</table>
</div>
<h2>DATA TYPES</h2>
<div class="cont">
<p>Data types refer to an extensive system used for <em> variables or functions of different types</em>. The type of a variable determines how
much space it occupies in storage and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted.<br>
Types of Data Types are :<br>
<strong>Basic Types:</strong><br>
They are arithmetic types and consists of the two types: (a) integer types and (b) floatingpoint types.<br>
<strong>Enumerated types:</strong><br>
They are again arithmetic types and they are used to define variables that can only be
assigned certain discrete integer values throughout the program.<br>
<strong>Derived types:</strong><br>
They include (a) Pointer types, (b) Array types, (c) Structure types, (d) Union types and
(e) Function types.<br>
We will see basic types in the following section.<br>
</p></div>
<h3>Integer Types</h3>
<div class="cont"><p>
Integer Type deals with those numeric values as the name says which are inetegers. The range of numbers depend upon the data type used as shown below:
<table>
<tr>
<th>DATA TYPE</th><th>BYTES</th><th>MIN</th><th>MAX</th>
<tr>
<td>int</td> <td>2</td> <td>-32,768</td><td>32,767</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>unsigned int</td><td> 2</td><td>0</td><td>65,535</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Short</td><td> 2</td><td>-32,768</td><td>32,767</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Long</td><td>4</td><td>-2,147,483,648</td><td>2,147,483,647</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>unsigned long</td><td>4</td><td>0</td><td>4,294,967,295</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>An example for variable initialization:</p></div>
<div class="code">
<pre>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <limits.h>
int main()
{
 printf("Storage size for int : %d \n", sizeof(int));

 return 0;
}</pre>
</div>
<div class="cont">
<p>OUTPUT: Storage size for int : 2<br><br><br>Here <strong>sizeof()</strong> is an already existing function which accepts a data type as its input and 
shows the size of the data type in terms of bytes.</p> </div>
<h3>Float Types</h3>
<table>
<tr>
<th>TYPE</th><th> STORAGE SIZE</th><th> VALUE RANGE</th><th> PRECISION</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>float </td><td>4 byte </td><td>1.2E-38 to 3.4E+38</td><td> 6 decimal places</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>double </td><td>8 byte </td><td>2.3E-308 to 1.7E+308 </td><td>15 decimal places</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>long double </td><td>10 byte</td><td> 3.4E-4932 to 1.1E+4932</td><td> 19 decimal places</td></tr>
</table>
<h2>VARIABLES</h2>
<div class="cont">
    <p>A variable is nothing but a name given to a storage area that our programs can
        manipulate. Each variable in C has a specific type, which determines the size and layout of
        the variable's memory; the range of values that can be stored within that memory; and the
        set of operations that can be applied to the variable.<br>
       Variable names can contain alphabets numbers and underscore. Variable name never starts with a 
       number and its case sensitive also. These are the predefined types :</p>
</div>
<div>
<table>
    <tr><th>TYPE</th><th>DESCRIPTION</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Char</td><td> Typically a single octet(one byte). This is an integer type.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Int</td><td> The most natural size of integer for the machine.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Float</td><td> A single-precision floating point value.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Double</td><td> A double-precision floating point value.</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Void</td><td> Represents the absence of type.</td></tr>

</table>
</div>
<h3>DECLARATION</h3>
<div class="cont">
    <p>A variable declaration provides assurance to the compiler that there is one variable existing with
       the given type and name. A variable declaration has its meaning at the time of
       compilation only, compiler needs actual variable declaration at the time of linking of the program.<br>
       The syntax for declaration is:
       <pre> data_type  variable_name ;</pre>
        </p></div>
<div class="code"><p><pre>
    #include<stdio.h>
    // Variable definition:
    extern int a, b;
    extern int c;
    extern float f;
    int main ()
    {
    // Variable definition:
    int a, b;
    int c;
    float f;
    // actual initialization
     a =10;</pre></p></div>

<h3 class="head">L AND R VALUE</h3>
<div class="cont"><p>
    <strong>lvalue:</strong> An expression that is an lvalue may appear as either the left-hand or right-hand
    side of an assignment.<br>
    <strong>rvalue:</strong> An expression that is an rvalue may appear on the right- but not left-hand side
    of an assignment.<br>
    In an assignment the lvalue comes at the left side and rvalue at the right side.<br>
    Ex: <span class="code"> int g=20 ;</span><br>
    Here <strong>r value</strong> is <strong>20</strong> and the <strong>l value</strong> is the <strong>memory location/address value</strong> 
    of the variable.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="head">CONSTANTS</h2>
<div class="cont">
    <p>The constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter during its
       execution. These fixed values are also called literals.<br>
       Constants can be defined by two methods:
       <ul class="unl">
           <li>Variable constant with help of <strong>const</strong> keyword</li>
           <li>Constants with <strong>#define</strong> preprocessor</li>
       </ul></div>
    <h3 class="head">const</h3>
    <div class="cont">
        Variable basic data types like an <strong>integer</strong> constant, a <strong>floating</strong>
        constant, a <strong>character</strong> constant, or a string literal can be declared with the help of beow mentioned syntax.<br>
        Syntax : <span class="code"> const data_type variable_name;</span></p>
    </div>
    <div class="code">
        <pre>#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
const int LENGTH = 10;
const int WIDTH = 5;
const char NEWLINE = '\n';
int area;
           
area = LENGTH * WIDTH;
printf("value of area : %d", area);
printf("%c", NEWLINE);
return 0;
}</pre>
    </div><span class="cont">Output: value of area : 50</span>
    <h3 class="head">#define</h3>
        <p>This is used in code for making general constant value where the value assigned to the quantity which could be anything.<br></p>
        <span class="code">#define pi 3.14159</span>

<h2>Operators Precedence in C</h2>
<p>Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression. This affects how an expression is evaluated. Certain operators have higher precedence than others; for example, the multiplication operator has higher precedence than the addition operator.<br> For example, x = 7 + 3 * 2; here, x is assigned 13, not 20 because operator * has higher precedence than +, so it first gets multiplied with 3*2 and then adds into 7.<br> Here, operators with the highest precedence appear at the top of the table, those with the lowest appear at the bottom. Within an expression, higher precedence operators will be evaluated first.</p>
