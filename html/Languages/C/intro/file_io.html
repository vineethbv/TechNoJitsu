<h1 id="fileio">File I/O</h1>
<div class="intro"><p>Last chapter explained about standard input and output devices handled by C programming language. This chapter we will see how C programmers can create, open, close text or binary files for their data storage.file represents a sequence of bytes, does not matter if it is a text file or binary file. C programming language provides access on high level functions as well as low level (OS level) calls to handle file on your storage devices. This chapter will take you through important calls for the file management.</p></div>
<h2 class="cont">opening files</h2>
<div class="cont"><p>You can use the fopen( ) function to create a new file or to open an existing file, this call will initialize an object of the type FILE, which contains all the information necessary to control the stream. Following is the prototype of this function call:<br><pre>FILE *fopen( const char * filename, const char * mode );</pre></p></div>
<div class="tbl"><table>
<tr><td><strong>mode</strong></td> <td><strong>discription</strong></td></tr>
<tr><td>r</td> <td>Opens an existing text file for reading purpose.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>w</td> <td>Opens a text file for writing, if it does not exist then a new file is created. Here your program will
start writing content from the beginning of the file.</td></tr>
<tr><td>a</td> <td>Opens a text file for writing in appending mode, if it does not exist then a new file is created.
Here your program will start appending content in the existing file content.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>r+</td> <td>Opens a text file for reading and writing both.
</td></tr>	
<tr><td>w+</td> <td>Opens a text file for reading and writing both. It first truncate the file to zero length if it exists
otherwise create the file if it does not exist.</td></tr>
<tr><td>a+</td> <td>Opens a text file for reading and writing both. It creates the file if it does not exist. The reading
will start from the beginning but writing can only be appended.
</td></tr></table></div>
<h2 class="cont">closing a files</h2>
<div class="cont"><p>To close a file, use the fclose( ) function. The prototype of this function is:<br><pre>int fclose( FILE *fp );</pre><br>The fclose( ) function returns zero on success, or EOF if there is an error in closing the file. This function actually, flushes any data still pending in the buffer to the file, closes the file, and releases any memory used for the file. The EOF is a constant defined in the header file stdio.h.</p></div>
<h2 class="cont">Writing a File</h2>
<div class="cont"><p>Following is the simplest function to write individual characters to a stream:<br><pre>int fputc( int c, FILE *fp );</pre><br>The function fputc() writes the character value of the argument c to the output stream referenced by fp. It returns the written character written on success otherwise EOF if there is an error. You can use the following functions to write a null-terminated string to a stream:<br><pre>int fputs( const char *s, FILE *fp ); </pre>The function fputs() writes the string s to the output stream referenced by fp. It returns a non-negative value on success, otherwise EOF is returned in case of any error.</p></div>
<h3 class="cont">example</h3>
<div class="code"><pre>
#include <stdio.h>
main()
{
    FILE *fp;
    fp = fopen("/tmp/test.txt", "w+");
    fprintf(fp, "This is testing for fprintf...\n");
    fputs("This is testing for fputs...\n", fp);
    fclose(fp);
}	
</pre></div>
<h2 class="cont">redaing a File</h2>
<div class="cont"><p>Following is the simplest function to read a single character from a file:
<br><pre>int fgetc( FILE * fp );</pre><br>The fgetc() function reads a character from the input file referenced by fp. The return value
is the character read, or in case of any error it returns EOF. The following functions allow
you to read a string from a stream:<br><pre>char *fgets( char *buf, int n, FILE *fp );</pre>The functions fgets() reads up to n - 1 characters from the input stream referenced by fp.
It copies the read string into the buffer buf, appending a null character to terminate the
string.</p></div>
<h3 class="cont">example</h3>
<div class="code"><pre>
#include <stdio.h>
main()
{
    FILE *fp;
    char buff[100];
    fp = fopen("/tmp/test.txt", "r");
    fscanf(fp, "%s", buff);
    printf("1 : %s\n", buff );
    fgets(buff, 255, (FILE*)fp);
    printf("2: %s\n", buff );
    fgets(buff, 255, (FILE*)fp);
    printf("3: %s\n", buff );
    fclose(fp);
}	
</pre></div>
<h2 class="cont">Binary I/O Functions</h2>
<div class="cont"><p>There are following two functions, which can be used for binary input and output:<br><pre>size_t fread(void *ptr, size_t size_of_elements,
 size_t number_of_elements, FILE *a_file);

size_t fwrite(const void *ptr, size_t size_of_elements,
 size_t number_of_elements, FILE *a_file);</pre><br>Both of these functions should be used to read or write blocks of memories - usually arrays or structures.</p></div>
