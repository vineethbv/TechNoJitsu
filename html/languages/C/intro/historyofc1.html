<h1 class="head">HISTORY OF C</h1>
<div class="intro">	
<p>C is a general-purpose programming language which features economny modern control flow and data structures, and a rich set of operators. C is not a <q>very high level</q> language, nor a <q>big</q> one, and is not of expression, specialized to any particular area of application. But its absence of restrictions and its generality make it more convenient and effective for many tasks than supposedly more powerful languages.<br>The history of C programming language is quite interesting. C was originally designed for and implemented on the<b> UNIX 0perating system</b> on the DEC PDP-1, by <i>Dennis Ritchie</i>. C is the result of a development process that started with an older language called BCPL. BCPL was developed by<i> Martin Richards</i>, and it influenced a language called B, which was invented by<i> Ken Thompson</i>.B led to the development of C in the 1970s.<br>For many years, the de facto standard for C was the version supplied with the UNIX operating system. In the summer of 1983 a committee was established to create an<b> ANSI (American National Standards Institute)</b> standard that would define the c language. The standardization process took six years (much longer than anyone reasonably 
expected).<br>The ANSIC standard was finally adopted in December 1989, with the first copies becoming available in early 1990. The standard was also adopted by ISO (nternational Standards organization), and the resulting standard was typically referred to as ANSI/ISso Standard C. In 1995, Amendment 1 to the C standard was adopted, which, among other things, added several new library functions. The 1989 standard for C, along with Amendment 1, became a base document for Standard C++, defining the C<b> subset of C++</b>. The version of C defined by the 1989 standard is commonly referred to as C89.<br>During the 1990s, a new standard for C was being developed. It was the 1999 standard for C, usually referred to as C99. In general, C99 retained nearly all of the features of C89. The C99 standardization committee focused on two main areas: the addition of several numeric libraries and the development of some special-use, but highly innovative, new features, such as variable-length arrays and the restrict pointer qualifier. These innovations have once again put C at the forefront of computer language development.<br>C89 is the version of C in widest use, it is currently accepted by all C compilers, and it forms the basis for C++.</p></div><br><br>
<h1 class="head">NEED OF C LANGUAGE</h1>
<div class="intro>
<p>As we studied earlier, C is a base language for many programming languages. So, learning C as the main language will play an important role while studying other programming languages. It shares the same concepts such as data types, operators, control statements and many more. C can be used widely in various applications. It is a simple language and provides faster execution. There are many jobs available for a 'C' developer in the current market.<br>C is a structured programming language in which program is divided into various modules. Each module can be written separately and together it forms a single C program. This structure makes it easy for testing, maintaining and debugging processes.<br>C contains 32 keywords, various data types and a set of powerful built-in functions that make programming very efficient.<br>Another feature of C programming is that it can extend itself. A C program contains various functions which are part of a library. We can add our features and functions to the library. We can access and use these functions anytime we want in our program. This feature makes it simple while working with complex programming.<br>Various compilers are available in the market that can be used for executing programs written in this language.<br><i>It is a highly portable language which means programs written in 'C' language can run on other machines</i>. This feature is essential if we wish to use or execute the code on another computer.</p><br><br>

<h2>K&R</h2>
<p>In 1978,<i>Brian Kernighan</i> and <i>Dennis Ritchie</i> published the first edition of The C Programming Language. This book, known to C programmers as <q>K&R</q>, served for many years as an informal specification of the language. The version of C that it describes is commonly referred to as K&R C. The second edition of the book covers the later <b>ANSI</b> C standard, described below.</p>
<h2>C89</h2>
<p>In 1983, the American National Standards Institute formed a committee, X3Jll, to establish a standard specification of C. The standard was completed in 1989 and ratified as ANSI X3.159-1989 "Programming Language C". This version of the language is often referred to as ANSI C. Later on sometimes the label C89 is used to distinguish it from C99 but using the same labelling method.</p>
<h2>C90</h2>
<p>The same standard as C89 was ratified by the International Organization for Standardization as ISO/IEC 9899:1990, with only formatting changes, which is sometimes referred to as C90. The terms C8191  and C90 refer to essentially the same language.</p>
<h2>C95</h2>
<p>In 1995, the ISO published an extension, called Amendment 1, for the ANSI-C standard. Its full name finally was ISO/IEC 9899/AMDI:1995 or nicknamed C95. Aside from error correction there were further changes to the language capabilities, Improved multi-byte and wide character support in the standard library,Several new core language features, including static array indices, designated initializers, compound literals, variable-length arrays, flexible array members, variadic macros,Removed several dangerous C89 language features such as implicit function declarations</p>
<h2>C11</h2>
<p>In 2007, work began on another revision of the C standard, informally called<q>CIX</q> until its official publication on 2011-12-15. Th,e C standards committee adopted guidelines to limit the adoption of new features that had not been tested by existing implementations.</p>
