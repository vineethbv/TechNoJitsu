        This is a simple project meant to demonstrate the usage of 8x8 matrix display with an Arduino. The project simply changes the image/pattern
        displayed after a certain delay measured in milliseconds.

          Please note that we have only recomended the above components based on reviews and pricing and we do not expect you to stick to these components' models strictly.

      <p class="note">
        To demonstrate this project our team has experimented using an MAX7219 8x8 matrix display. You can find other matrix displays as well, though this program
        focuses on an MAX7219 8x8 matrix display in particular.
      </p>
      <p class="note" id="connections">
        <p>
          To start off with, an MAX7219 8x8 matrix display consists Vcc, GND, DIN, CS, and CLK pins. So our connection diagram for this project with an Arduino (UNO in particular)
          goes as follows:
          <table border="2">
          <tr><th>ARDUINO BOARD</th><th>MAX7219</th></tr>
          <tr><td>9</td><td>CLOCK</td></tr>
          <tr><td>10</td><td>CS</td></tr>
          <tr><td>11</td><td>DIN</td></tr>
          <tr><td>GND</td><td>GND</td></tr>
          <tr><td>5V</td><td>VCC</td></tr>
          </table>
        </p>
        <p>
          The connections made between ports 8, 9 and 10 to DIN, CS, CLK respectively can also be altered based on the requirements of your projects and isn't a fixed connection. As always, GND on any component is connected to GND on your Arduino board.
          Vcc is always connected to either 5V or 3.3V based on which component you use, and in this case it is connected to 5V.
        </p>
      </p>
      <p class="note" id="startersGuide">
        In order to program this board after making the necessary connections, you will need the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software">Arduino IDE</a>. If this is your first time using the IDE, then you will need to set up your board on the IDE.
        Please follow this link to set up your board if it is your first time using an Arduino: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/howto">How to set up Arduino board</a>.
        Once you have set up your Arduino board, you must include the necessary libraries for that particular project. In this case, you need <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/wayoda/LedControl">LedControl</a> library for this project. Download the file and extract it to the same
        directory as your Arduino directory (By default C:\Users\usr\Documents\Arduino\libraries).
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that we have everything set up, we can start programming our Arduino. You can find the code in our developer's GitHub repository: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/vinsdragonis/Arduino-8x8-matrix/blob/master/EMO%20Project/MatrixDisplayEMO.ino">EMO project</a>
        Once entered, feel free to make any changes you wish while giving credits to the author for his contributions. After you made any / no changes to the code, save the file and keep in mind the file extension must be .imo as it is meant to be imported to your Arduino board.
        After compiling and uploading the file to your Arduino, you can notice a number of images or patterns after a certain delay that show up on your matrix display. And successfully completes this project.
